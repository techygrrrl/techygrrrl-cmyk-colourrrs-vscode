# Contributing

Contributions may be welcome depending on what they are. 

A best effort was done to theme all available properties but this project was started from scratch, so it's possible some properties were missed and do not conform to the desired [colour guide](https://u1tlwy.csb.app/). Any contributions in identifying and maybe even fixing them are welcome.

Reports for severe contrast issues may also be welcome.

Please create an issue with a detailed description and screenshots in the [Github issues queue](https://github.com/techygrrrl/techygrrrl-cmyk-colourrrs-vscode/issues) in order to verify that your work would be accepted first before starting so that your efforts are not wasted.

If your issue is accepted, only authorized colours should be used in your changes. See those [here](https://u1tlwy.csb.app/). Semi-transparent versions of acceptable colours may also be acceptable.
